### Special relais Version with "double contact":  
In the AccuSound [version from 1995 to 2003](https://github.com/analoghifi/Thel-AccuSound-100/tree/a5d61b718bfbff7d215130f20023479826e87e46/hardware/3)%20version%201995-2003) Thel uses a special relais where the contact is designed as a double contact â€“ a standard (AgSnO) contact and a [tungsten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten) (german: "Wolfram") leading contact ("pre-make contact").  
The tungsten leading contact closes earlier than the standard (AgSnO) contact when it is switched on. The latter is spared from the switch-on peaks. Only the lower continuous current flows through the standard (AgSnO) contact. At the moment of switch-off, the tungsten leading contact opens correspondingly later and thus keeps switch-off peaks (and sparks) away from the standard contact.  
Originally Thel used a [Hengstler H-550-1759](https://github.com/analoghifi/Thel-AccuSound-100/tree/a5d61b718bfbff7d215130f20023479826e87e46/docs/components%20datasheets/special%20relay%20version%201995-2003/Original%3A%20Hengstler%20H-550) relais  
alternatively you may use [Weidmueller RCLS3T024(W)](https://github.com/analoghifi/Thel-AccuSound-100/tree/a5d61b718bfbff7d215130f20023479826e87e46/docs/components%20datasheets/special%20relay%20version%201995-2003/Alternative%3A%20Weidmueller%20RCLS3T024(W)) if you want this double contact feature (although this was never used by Thel)
