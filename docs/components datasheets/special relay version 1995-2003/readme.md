### Relay type: Weidmüller \"RCL Inrush Power\":  
In the \"RCL Inrush\" version, the relays offer a NO contact (AgSnO) with a nominal current of 16 A and have a making capacity of 120 A for 20 ms.  
In the **\"RCL Inrush Power\"** version, the contact is designed as a double contact – a standard (AgSnO) contact and a tungsten leading contact ("pre-make contact").

The tungsten leading contact closes earlier than the standard (AgSnO) contact when it is switched on. The latter is spared from the switch-on peaks. Only the lower continuous current flows through the standard (AgSnO) contact. At the moment of switch-off, the tungsten leading contact opens correspondingly later and thus keeps switch-off peaks away from the standard contact.

Tungsten, the contact material of the pre-make contact, absorbs inrush currents with capacitive loads of 165 A for 20 ms.  
The capacitive inrush peaks can be 800 A/200 µs. With inductive loads, the tungsten contact absorbs high breaking currents.
