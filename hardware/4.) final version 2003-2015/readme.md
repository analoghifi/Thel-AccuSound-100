Accusound 100 = with normal 1% (metal film) resistors  
Accusound 10**1** = \"with low noise non-magnetic TKD-resistors 0.5% TCR:25ppm\" (until 2005: \"with low noise Welwyn-resistors 0.1% TCR:15ppm\")  
### Changes over the years:  
**4.1)** initial version (using the black Mundorf \"MCap audiophile\" KP caps [100V])
  
**4.2.1)** in 2006 there was a small layout change on the PCB to give space for the new better KP (film/foil) input cap (CDE WPP-series) paralleled with a small silver mica cap.  
(at the same time the two small holes at the bottom of the PCB disappeared)  
  
**4.2.2)** in the middle of 2010: replacement of the 2 very good <a href="/docs/components datasheets/special relay version 1995-2003">tungsten-silver double (two-step) contact relays</a> (erosion-resistant) with 2 normal "high-current" relays (Schrack RP3SL024)
  
**4.3)** in 2011 there was again a small layout change on the PCB to give the input capacitor even more space (compare the pics in the lower right corner),  
with that change the (more expensive) Accusound 10**1** got a (larger dimensions) 3.3µF input capacitor as a 'bonus' (instead of the normal 2.2µF of the Accusound 100)  
(the schematic is still the same (as it was from 2003 on), as well as all the components)
