Accusound 100 = with normal 1% (metal film) resistors  
Accusound 10**1** = \"with low noise non-magnetic TKD-resistors 0.5% TCR:25ppm\" (until 2005: \"with low noise Welwyn-resistors 0.1% TCR:15ppm\")  
  
4.1) initial version (using Mundorf \"MCap\" **M**KP caps)
  
4.2) in 2006 there was a small layout change on the PCB to give space for the new better KP (film/foil) input cap (CDE WPP-series) paralleled with a small silver mica cap.  
(at the same time the two small holes at the bottom of the PCB disappeared)  
  
4.3) in 2011 there was again a small layout change on the PCB to give the input capacitor even more space (compare the pics in the lower right corner),  
with that change the (more expensive) Accusound 10**1** got a (larger dimensions) 3.3µF input capacitor as a 'bonus' (instead of the normal 2.2µF of the Accusound 100)  
(the schematic is still the same (as it was from 2003 on), as well as all the components)
