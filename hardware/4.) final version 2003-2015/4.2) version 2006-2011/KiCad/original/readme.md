#### work in progress not finished yet !  

this is not the original Thel PCB but it's very like\* the original with the following exceptions:  
* different board dimensions original: 200mm x 100mm -> this PCB: 200mm x 103mm  
* using a combined 5.0mm/7.5mm pin spacing footprint for the small foil caps C12 and C23  
  
\*(same schematic / same 1-layer\** layout THT / same THT components in the same places on the board)  
\**(strictly speaking, this KiCad PCB is a two-layer PCB with plated-through holes, but you can also (let) produce it as a classic 1-layer PCB with non-plated holes if you wish, since all the tracks are on the bottom side only)

these are KiCad 6.x projects
